"Tidy data" means that each observation has its own row and each variable has its own column.


# **==The choice between label encoding and one-hot encoding ==

for categorical encoding depends on the specific context and the nature of your data.

Label Encoding:

- Label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category in the categorical variable.
- It is suitable for ordinal variables, where the categories have an inherent order or rank.
- Label encoding preserves the ordinal relationship between categories.
- However, label encoding may introduce unintended ordinality in nominal variables, leading to misleading results.

One-Hot Encoding:

- One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category in the categorical variable.
- Each category is represented by a binary column (0 or 1) indicating its presence or absence.
- It is suitable for nominal variables without an inherent order.
- One-hot encoding avoids introducing ordinality and treats each category as independent.
- However, one-hot encoding may result in high-dimensional data if there are many categories in the variable.

In general, if your categorical variable is ordinal, you can consider using label encoding. If the variable is nominal or has no inherent order, one-hot encoding is typically a better choice.

It's worth noting that the choice of encoding method can also depend on the specific machine learning algorithm you plan to use. Some algorithms may work better with one encoding method over the other. Therefore, it is recommended to experiment with different encoding approaches and evaluate their impact on your specific task and model performance.
