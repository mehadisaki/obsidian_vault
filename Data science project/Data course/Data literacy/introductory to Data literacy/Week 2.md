# Data Collection and Cleaning: 1days

Types of Data
-   -   Introduction to different types of data: This will involve providing an overview of the three main types of data â€“ structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Each type of data will be explained in terms of its characteristics, such as how it is stored, its level of organization, and its format.
    
-   Differences between data types: This section will discuss the differences between the different types of data, including their uses, advantages, and limitations. Structured data, for example, is commonly used in databases and is organized into rows and columns. In contrast, unstructured data is typically text-heavy and has no predefined structure, such as emails or social media posts.
    
-   Hands-on exercise: Learners will be given a practical exercise to identify examples of each type of data. This could involve analyzing a real-world dataset or a set of examples that have been provided. This exercise will help learners to understand the different characteristics of each type of data and how they can be used in different contexts.
