## Data Science Process and Workflow  - 20 minutes

[Opening scene: A presenter standing in front of a whiteboard]

Presenter: "Welcome back to Week 2 of our course on Data Science in Manufacturing. Today, we're going to dive into the Data Science Process and Workflow, which is a structured approach to guide our data analysis journey. So let's get started!"

[Slide 1: Introduction]

Presenter: "Before we begin, let's briefly recap the key components of the Data Science Process and Workflow."

Presenter: "The Data Science Process consists of several phases, including Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. These phases provide a systematic and organized framework for us to follow in our data analysis journey."

[Slide 2: Business Understanding]

Presenter: "The first phase of the Data Science Process is Business Understanding. In this phase, we aim to gain a deep understanding of the manufacturing industry and its specific challenges and objectives."

Presenter: "We need to ask critical questions such as: What are the key problems or opportunities in the manufacturing domain? What data-driven insights can help us address these challenges and drive improvements? By understanding the business context, we can align our data analysis efforts with the goals of the manufacturing industry."

[Slide 3: Data Understanding]

Presenter: "Once we have a clear understanding of the business context, we move on to the Data Understanding phase. This phase involves exploring and familiarizing ourselves with the manufacturing data we have."

Presenter: "We need to assess the quality, structure, and relevance of the data. This includes identifying the different data sources, understanding data formats, and examining any limitations or biases in the data. The goal is to gain insights into what data is available and how it can be used to address the manufacturing challenges."

[Slide 4: Data Preparation]

Presenter: "With a solid understanding of the data, we proceed to the Data Preparation phase. This is a crucial step where we clean, transform, and organize the data for analysis."

[Visuals: Data cleaning and transformation processes]

Presenter: "Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any data inconsistencies. Data transformation may involve aggregating data, creating new variables, or normalizing data for better comparability. The goal is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and in a suitable format for further analysis."

[Slide 5: Modeling]

Presenter: "Once the data is prepared, we move into the Modeling phase. This is where we apply various statistical and machine learning techniques to gain insights from the manufacturing data."

[Visuals: Statistical and machine learning models]

Presenter: "We can use predictive modeling to forecast production performance, identify maintenance needs, or optimize manufacturing processes. Machine learning algorithms can help detect anomalies, classify product defects, or improve quality control. The key is to select the appropriate models that align with the manufacturing objectives and apply them effectively to the data."

[Slide 6: Evaluation and Deployment]

Presenter: "After modeling, we enter the Evaluation phase. Here, we assess the performance and validity of our models and analysis."

[Visuals: Evaluation metrics and performance assessment]

Presenter: "We evaluate how well our models align with the manufacturing objectives, measure their accuracy and effectiveness, and identify any areas for improvement. This phase ensures that our data analysis efforts are reliable and actionable."

Presenter: "Finally, we reach the Deployment phase, where we communicate the results and implement our findings in the manufacturing industry."
