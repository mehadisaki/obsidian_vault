**Pareto analysis** is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of action are competing for attention. In essence, the problem-solver estimates the benefit delivered by each action, then selects a number of the most effective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal possible one.

Pareto analysis is a creative way of looking at causes of problems because it helps stimulate thinking and organize thoughts. However, it can be limited by its exclusion of possibly important problems which may be small initially, but will grow with time. It should be combined with other analytical tools such as [failure mode and effects analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis "Failure mode and effects analysis") and [fault tree analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis "Fault tree analysis") for example.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

This technique helps to identify the top portion of causes that need to be addressed to resolve the majority of problems. Once the predominant causes are identified, then tools like the [Ishikawa diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram "Ishikawa diagram") or Fish-bone Analysis can be used to identify the root causes of the problems. While it is common to refer to pareto as "80/20" rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20% of causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of thumb and is not, nor should it be considered, an immutable law of nature.

The application of the Pareto analysis in risk management allows management to focus on those risks that have the most impact on the project.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_analysis#cite_note-1)
