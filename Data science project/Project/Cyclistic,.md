1.  Introduction
    
  Cyclistic is a bike-share company operating in Chicago with a customer base that consists of two types of riders: casual riders and annual members. The company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. The director of marketing believes that understanding the behavior of these two types of riders can help in designing an effective marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

   To achieve this goal, we will be conducting an analysis of Cyclistic’s ridership data to identify any differences in the behavior of casual riders and annual members. The analysis will provide insights that can help in designing an effective marketing campaign to convert casual riders into annual members. The recommendations will be based on compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

   The objective of this portfolio project is to use our data analysis and visualization skills to help Cyclistic increase its annual membership and create a successful marketing strategy. This project will demonstrate our expertise in data analysis and visualization, and how we can leverage data to solve real-world business problems.


2.  Business problem statement
    
    -   Provide a more detailed description of the business problem Cyclistic is facing and why it is important for the company's future success.
    -   Explain the hypothesis that casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and how this relates to the business problem.
    -   Clearly state the project's objective, which is to analyze Cyclistic's bike-share data to uncover how casual riders and annual members use the service differently and provide actionable insights to inform the new marketing strategy.

	Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, has been successful in attracting customers through its flexible pricing plans that offer single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. However, the company's finance analysts have identified that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing, Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Therefore, the marketing team needs to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. To do this, they must analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify trends and understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The goal of the project is to provide compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to back up the marketing team's recommendations for a new marketing strategy that targets casual riders and converts them into annual members.

	Cyclistic, a successful bike-share offering in Chicago, is facing a crucial business problem that could impact the company's future success. While the program has been flexible in its pricing plans and targeted broad consumer segments, the company's marketing strategy needs to focus on maximizing the number of annual memberships to drive profitability. To achieve this, Cyclistic executives need to better understand the differences in behavior between casual riders and annual members and identify ways to convert casual riders to annual members.

	The hypothesis is that casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and that understanding these differences could provide actionable insights to drive the company's marketing strategy. By analyzing Cyclistic's bike-share data, we aim to uncover key trends and insights into how these customer segments use the service differently, with the objective of providing the marketing team with valuable insights that can inform the new marketing strategy.

	Therefore, the project's objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of Cyclistic's bike-share data to uncover how casual riders and annual members use the service differently and provide actionable insights to inform the new marketing strategy.
