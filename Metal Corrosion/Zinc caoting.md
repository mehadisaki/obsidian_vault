## Factors Affecting the Galvanized Coating Life

The durability of the galvanized coatings depends on the following environmental factors:

-   pH of moisture
-   Ambient temperature
-   Nature of exposure (open, sheltered)
-   Contact with other chemicals
-   Contact with different metals
-   Ventilation conditions
-   Chloride levels in the atmosphere
-   Sulfate levels in the atmosphere
-   Time of wetness
-   Orientation of exposure (vertical, horizontal)



An ASTM standard has been developed for modified salt spray testing. It is G85 Standard Practice for Modified Salt Spray (Fog) Testing, and has several modifications involving cyclic additions of acid and SO2. This standard is not as widely used as B117. Method A5 of G85 has been found by some producers to be able to rank ==materials== and coatings similar to that witnessed in actual servicei .

# Corrosion rate measurment 

Corrosion rate is the rate at which a metal corrodes over time. It is typically measured in units of weight loss per unit area per unit time, such as milligrams per square meter per year (mg/m^2/yr) or microns per year (µm/yr).

The corrosion rate of galvanized steel depends on a variety of factors, including the type of galvanized coating (such as hot-dip or electro-galvanized), the thickness of the coating, the environment in which the steel is exposed (such as the presence of moisture, salt, or pollutants), and the quality of the coating.

In general, galvanized steel has a lower corrosion rate compared to uncoated steel. However, the corrosion rate of galvanized steel can vary significantly depending on the specific conditions of the environment.

For example, in an industrial coastal environment with high levels of salt and humidity, the corrosion rate of galvanized steel can be quite high, ==typically in the range of 1-2 µm/yr.== In a more moderate environment, such as a rural or suburban area with less exposure to pollutants and salt, the corrosion rate of galvanized steel can be much lower, typically in the range of 0.1-0.5 µm/yr.

In addition, the corrosion rate can also vary depending on the type of galvanized coating and its thickness. Generally, thicker coatings have a lower corrosion rate than thinner coatings. Hot-dip galvanized steel typically have higher corrosion resistance than electro-galvanized steel.

It's important to note that these are general figures and the corrosion rate can vary significantly depending on the specific conditions of the environment, the quality of the coating, the steel composition and other factors. It's important to consult with a corrosion expert and perform corrosion test, like salt spray test, to determine the corrosion rate of the galvanized steel in a specific situation and application.

## How to measure zinc coating decay is time. what's the correlation between them

There are several methods that can be used to measure the decay of zinc coating over time, including:

1.  Visual inspection: This method involves visually inspecting the coating for signs of deterioration, such as discoloration, cracking, peeling, or the presence of rust. This method is simple and inexpensive, but it can be subjective and may not provide a quantitative measure of coating decay.
    
2.  Measurement of coating thickness: This method involves measuring the thickness of the zinc coating using techniques such as magnetic thickness gauges, ultrasonic thickness gauges, or X-ray fluorescence (XRF). This method can provide a quantitative measure of coating decay, but it may require specialized equipment and expertise.
    
3.  Adhesion testing: This method involves measuring the adhesion of the coating to the substrate using techniques such as tape test, pull-off test or cross-cut test. This method can provide a measure of the integrity of the coating and its ability to protect the substrate from corrosion.
    
4.  Corrosion rate measurement: This method involves measuring the corrosion rate of the zinc coating using techniques such as electrochemical techniques or weight loss measurements. This method can provide a measure of the coating's ability to protect the substrate from corrosion.

# Pollution Simulation

There are several tests that can be used to simulate the effects of pollution on galvanized steel. Some of the more accurate tests include:

1.  Salt Spray Test (ASTM B117): This test exposes the coated steel to a salt spray mist, which simulates the effects of saltwater on the steel. The test is conducted in a controlled environment, and the steel is evaluated for signs of corrosion after a specified period of time.
    
2.  Humidity Test (ASTM D2247): This test exposes the coated steel to a high humidity environment, which simulates the effects of a humid climate on the steel. The test is conducted in a controlled environment, and the steel is evaluated for signs of corrosion after a specified period of time.
    
3.  Cyclic Corrosion Test (ASTM G85): This test exposes the coated steel to a series of different environments, such as salt spray, humidity, and heat. The steel is evaluated for signs of corrosion after each cycle. This test simulates the effects of long-term exposure to a variety of different weather conditions.
    
4.  CASS Test (ASTM B368): Copper-Accelerated Acetic Salt Spray test is similar to Salt Spray Test, but with higher corrosion rate. The test is used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of coatings on aluminum and zinc-alloy-coated steel.
    
5.  QUV Test : QUV Accelerated Weathering Tester is used to simulate the effect of sunlight, rain, and dew on materials, so it's suitable to test the corrosion resistance of coating on steel.
    
6.  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) : This test uses electrical measurements to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coating. It can be used to measure the corrosion rate and predict the service life of the coating.
    

It's important to note that no single test can fully simulate the effects of pollution on galvanized steel in all environments. It's important to consult with a corrosion expert to evaluate the specific conditions of the environment and recommend the best test method or combination of methods to simulate the effects of pollution on galvanized steel.

## Corrosion rate measurement Technique

 Corrosion rate measurementis a method for determining the rate at which a coating, such as zinc, is deteriorating or corroding. There are several techniques that can be used to measure the corrosion rate of zinc coatings, including:

1.  Electrochemical techniques: This method involves measuring the electrical current flowing through the coating during corrosion. This can be done by applying a small voltage to the coating and measuring the current flowing through it. The corrosion rate can then be calculated by measuring the change in the coating's electrical resistance over time. This method can provide a precise measure of the corrosion rate, but it may require specialized equipment and expertise.
    
2.  Weight loss measurements: This method involves measuring the weight of the coating over time, and subtracting the final weight from the initial weight to determine the amount of corrosion that has occurred. The corrosion rate can then be calculated by dividing the weight loss by the time over which the corrosion occurred. This method is simple and inexpensive, but it may not provide a precise measure of the corrosion rate.
    
3.  Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR): This method involves measuring the corrosion rate by measuring the change in resistance of the coating over time. This method can be done by applying a small DC current to the coating and measuring the voltage across it. The corrosion rate can then be calculated by measuring the change in the coating's resistance over time.
    
4.  Potentiodynamic Polarization (PDP): This method involves measuring the corrosion rate by measuring the change in the coating's potential over time. This method can be done by applying a small AC current to the coating and measuring the potential across it. The corrosion rate can then be calculated by measuring the
