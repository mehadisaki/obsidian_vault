Corrosion is a natural process that occurs when metal comes into contact with the environment. It can cause significant damage to steel structures and equipment, leading to costly repairs and replacements. Steel is particularly susceptible to corrosion, which is why it is often coated with a protective layer to prevent rust and corrosion.

One of the most popular coatings for steel is zinc, which is applied through a process called galvanization. Zinc coating provides a barrier between the steel and the environment, protecting the steel from rust and corrosion. Additionally, zinc coating also acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding preferentially to the steel and providing additional protection. The thickness of the zinc coating can vary depending on the specific application and the intended service life of the steel. Generally, thicker coatings will provide better corrosion resistance and a longer service life. The thickness of zinc coating that is recommended for preventing corrosion in tropical areas like Bangladesh is typically between 55-80 microns.

However, the real problem is that even though the steel has been coated with zinc, it may still corrode due to other factors such as pollution and environmental conditions. In Bangladesh, the high levels of pollution and humidity in the urban and country areas can accelerate the corrosion of steel. This is why it is important to use advanced corrosion prevention coatings and other methods such as cathodic protection systems or sacrificial anodes to protect the steel.

One of the advanced coating that is used on steel is 1.5% Mg-Al-Zinc coating which is composed of a mixture of zinc, magnesium, and aluminum, which provides excellent protection against corrosion. The Mg-Al alloy forms a protective layer on the surface of the coating, which slows down the corrosion rate of the zinc. Additionally, the aluminum in the coating also improves the adhesion and ductility of the coating.

To measure the corrosion rate of galvanized steel and to predict the service life of the coating, several tests are used. Salt Spray Test, Humidity Test, Cyclic Corrosion Test, CASS Test and QUV test are the most common tests. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is also a popular method that uses electrical measurements to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coating. EIS devices such as Gamry, Solartron, and Autolab are some of the most commonly used devices in this method.

In conclusion, it's important to use the proper thickness of zinc coating and advanced corrosion prevention coatings, and to conduct regular testing to ensure that steel is protected against corrosion in Bangladesh and other tropical areas. It's also important to consult


Measuring the life time of electro-galvanized steel in a lab can be done through a number of methods, such as salt spray test, humidity test, cyclic corrosion test, CASS test, and QUV test. These tests are used to simulate the effects of pollution on the steel and to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coating.

Electrochemical techniques, such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), can also be used to measure the corrosion rate of galvanized steel. EIS uses electrical measurements to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coating and can be used to predict the service life of the coating. Some of the popular EIS devices are: Gamry Reference 600, Autolab PGSTAT302N and ZRA-15.

Another important factor to consider is the environmental pollution in Bangladesh, which can have a significant impact on the corrosion rate of steel. The pollution in urban areas is generally higher than in rural areas, which can accelerate the corrosion process. In addition, gases such as SO2, NOx and Cl2 can also contribute to the corrosion of steel.




Steel corrosion is a significant problem in Bangladesh, particularly in the coastal and urban areas where the environment is highly corrosive. The high humidity, saltwater, and pollution in these regions can cause severe damage to unprotected steel structures and equipment.

To combat this problem, many steel products in Bangladesh are coated with zinc through a process called galvanization. Zinc coating provides a barrier between the steel and the environment, protecting it from rust and corrosion. Additionally, zinc coating also acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding preferentially to the steel and providing additional protection.

In order to ensure that the zinc coating is effective in preventing corrosion, it is important to use coatings with the appropriate thickness. For applications in Bangladesh, it is recommended to use coatings with a thickness of at least 55 microns. This thickness provides adequate protection in the highly corrosive environment found in the country.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the zinc coating, several tests can be used. One of the most common tests is the Salt Spray Test (ASTM B117), which simulates the effects of saltwater on the steel. Other tests such as Humidity Test (ASTM D2247), Cyclic Corrosion Test (ASTM G85), CASS Test (ASTM B368) and QUV test can also be used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coating.

Additionally, electrochemical techniques such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can also be used to measure the corrosion rate of the coating and predict the service life of the galvanized steel. Corrosion rate can be measured by using techniques such as Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR) and Electrochemical Noise (EN).

However, it's important to note that even with the best coatings and tests, steel corrosion in Bangladesh can still occur due to other factors such as gas pollution and high pollution levels. To combat this problem, sacrificial anodes or cathodic protection systems can be used. Additionally, using advanced corrosion prevention coatings such as 1.5% Mg-Al-zinc coating can provide better protection against corrosion.
