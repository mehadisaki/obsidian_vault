-   Some media outlets criticize Erdogan for his expansionist ambitions, citing Syria and the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus.
-   Free elections are rare in the Middle East, and Turkey's election, though polarized and uneven, is considered free.
-   The media's hostility towards Erdogan raises questions about their treatment of other less democratic leaders in the region.
-   The outcome of the election hinges on two factors: the unity of the opposition around a liberal candidate and Erdogan's economic mismanagement, which has affected the purchasing power of Turks.
