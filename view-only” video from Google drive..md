Here is a technique by which you can download a “view-only” video from Google drive.

1.  Open the Inspect element. You can get this by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + I (on Mac: Option + Command + I)
2.  Inside the inspect element, Open the “Network” Tab.

3. Search for “videoplayback” on the filter search. Make sure that you have selected “All” under the different file options available. If nothing shows up still, then reload the page and repeat the steps.
